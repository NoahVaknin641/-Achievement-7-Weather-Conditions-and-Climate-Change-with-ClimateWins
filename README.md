# ClimateWins: Predicting Weather and Climate Change with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

Welcome to the ClimateWins project! This initiative leverages machine learning to predict the consequences of climate change, with a focus on weather conditions in mainland Europe. Developed as part of a data analytics journey at the European nonprofit organization, ClimateWins, this project integrates data science and analytics to deliver actionable insights for climate preparedness.

## Organization Profile

**ClimateWins** is a European nonprofit working to understand and anticipate the consequences of climate change. With limited resources, ClimateWins empowers data analysts to step into advanced roles, performing tasks across data analysis, data science, research, and machine learning.

## Goal

The primary goal is to use machine learning to:
- Assess and categorize weather conditions
- Predict extreme weather events using historical data
- Support strategic planning for climate change adaptation

## Data Sources

The project utilizes a diverse set of global weather and climate datasets, including:
- Hurricane predictions from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, USA)
- Typhoon data from the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA, Japan)
- Historical and recent world temperature records
- Other open climate and weather datasets

## Key Questions

1. **How is machine learning used in weather prediction?**
2. **What ethical concerns exist around ML/AI in this context?**
3. **What are historical temperature extremes?**
4. **Can weather conditions be predicted for specific days, including potential hazards?**

## Approach

- **Learn and apply machine learning methods**: Focus on both supervised and unsupervised learning for weather data analysis.
- **Data Preparation**: Clean, preprocess, and explore datasets to ensure suitability for ML modeling.
- **Model Selection**: Experiment with various ML models to identify those best suited for weather prediction tasks.
- **Analysis and Reporting**: Clearly communicate findings and recommendations to guide ClimateWinsâ€™ strategies.
